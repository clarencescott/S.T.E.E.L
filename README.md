## What is S.T.E.E.L?
S.T.E.E.L is <b>Students Thriving in Engineering & Emerging Leadership</b>. It is a project I would like to begin, offering very cheap pricing to assist highschoolers looking to get into engineering careers, highschool graduates actively preparing for engineering studies in college OR college students with minimal coding abilities looking to start a portfolio for themselves.

# S.T.E.E.L Portfolio Project
## Overview
Welcome to the Engineering Portfolio Project! This initiative is designed to assist middle and high school students aged 10-17 (and adults 18+) who are passionate about pursuing careers in engineering. By participating in this project, participants will have the opportunity to build professional web portfolios using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including React and Node.js). These portfolios will showcase their skills, projects, and achievements, helping them stand out to potential employers and college admissions committees.

## Features
- Comprehensive Portfolio Building: Students will create dynamic and professional web portfolios.
- Affordable Participation: The cost for each portfolio is only $20 per student.
- GitHub Hosting: Portfolios will be hosted on GitHub using GitHub Pages (github.io).
- Long-Term Support: Students will receive weekly support until they land a career or complete their college education, or until they decide they no longer need help.
- Career & Academic Guidance: In addition to technical skills, students will receive guidance on showcasing their journey, skills, and achievements effectively.
